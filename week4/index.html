        <p>Hello!! My name is Junior Mariluz and I am from Lima, Peru. I enjoy studying at BYU Idaho. I was born in Peru, the capital of Lima, in the district of Villa Maria del Triumph, my parents are married, currently separated, I live in my mother's house with my 8-year-old son, I am the fourth advisor of the elders quorum, leader of JAS and person in charge of Family History, knowing the church and getting closer to the heavenly father changed my life completely in every way, I am blessed with health, my family is united, despite some challenges we have, I am also trying very hard to be a good professional. Being a father is a very difficult job, but with the heavenly father he guides me to be able to improve as a person and as a father and as a son, I know that he will not abandon me.</p>

        <p>Lima is the capital of Peru, located on the country's arid Pacific coast. Despite its preserved colonial center, it is a sprawling metropolis and one of the largest cities in South America. The Larco Museum houses a collection of pre-Columbian art, and the Museum of the Nation traces the history of Peru's ancient civilizations. The Plaza de Armas and the 16th-century cathedral are the heart of Lima's old town.</p>
